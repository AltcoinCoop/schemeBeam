# schemeBeam

A free, open source referral marketing application similar in function to Maitre or Viral Loops. 

* With schemeBeam you can create a lander page for a viral campaign which asks for entrants email address in exchange for a personal referral link. 
* Entrants can share this link on social media to increase their ranking in a contest for a prize. Every friend and associate of theirs that signs up will also receive a link, furthering the reach of the campaign.
* When entrants verify their email address, it will be added automatically to your SendGrid contacts list. Full list of emails or full list of prize winners can also be downloaded in CSV format.
* Entrants can also check on their position in the contest by visiting the stats page.
* You can select the number of winners per contest, check on relevant data, and customize the lander page's message through the admin UI.

schemeBeam will be available soon, along with installation instructions and a tutorial. Please follow and star the repository if you would like to stay updated.
